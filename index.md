My name is Phil Heijkoop, welcome to my site. I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner, with a particular passion for robotics/AI, machine learning, and computational biology. I invite you to read about some of my projects or read some of my thoughts on the blog. Alternatively, read a little about me in the [about me]({{site.url}}/about) section, check out some of my social media presence in the footer, or check out my [Github](http://www.github.com/mephistophyles).

I am still working on polishing some of my projects and putting them on my Github, so bear with me as the site starts to fill out.
