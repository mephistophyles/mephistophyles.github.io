Welcome to my site. Currently running a semi-custom dual-blog set up, based on Jekyll and hosted by Github pages. I invite you to explore some of my achievements (under the Projects tab) and read some of my blog entries (under Blog).

Currently working on: 

* getting this site up and running:
  * Put a nice theme or color scheme on it (it's a bit bland now)
  * Committing my code for projects to Github (or Jupyter notebooks?) for better accessibility
* adding (working) links to the research papers I've written
* Upload current project to blog entries
* Write up finished projects and add as project entries
* Finding a job in Boston
