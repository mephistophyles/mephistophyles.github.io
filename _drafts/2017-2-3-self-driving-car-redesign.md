title: Redesigning the Car

It is my firm belief that with the inevitable arrival of self-driving cars, we should take a good hard look at redesigning the automobile. We have changed the way both cars and trucks look to make them safer for their human occupants (and increase performance and make them look nice). However, one of the key constraints involved in this endeavour will soon no longer hold: requiring the driver to be front facing with good fields of view.

In fact, removing this requirement as a whole woul allow designers to change transportation methods and also use different sensor combinations/orientations than before. Currently assuming the automation of vehicles will lead to a reduction/elimination of traffic accidents (not necessarily true, but let's take it as a mental exercise for now). The following are just a few what-ifs:

* Trucks may become more like bullet trains, where they are mainly designed to be fuel and space efficient. 
* Busses may be redesigned similarly, allowing for more slightly longer vehicles that can seat people more spaciously like most trains, since being manouverable for a human driver is no longer a consideration.
* Commuter vehicles (assuming Uber doesn't get their way and we don't just order one) can become more comfortable, either allowing their single occupant to work or sleep or watch a movie. Or they can become more social, having their occupants face one another like in caravans, where everyone can play cards.

I'm fully aware a lot of car manufacturers have built a strong sense of brand recognition into their vehicle designs (BMW grills and forms are quite iconic), but I feel it is not only something car manufacturers should explore, but maybe even something they will head to out of themselves as they start to respond to a changing market.
