title: Climate Change Preparation

The science of anthropogenic (ie human-caused) climate change is pretty much settled and it is a reality we must all face. While current news seems dominated by efforts to keep the debate running and education efforts seem to be ineffectual towards those in power, a more pressing question is "what can the average person expect and do to prepare?".  This is where things get tricky, since we *can* predict a number of general outcomes relating to the climate, but *can't* precisely predict, especially those of secondary and tertiary nature, what this will mean for our day-to-day lives. This means inference from what we do know is only worth so much, since it's quite possible an unknown secondary effect could make our initial strategy unwise. 

Allow me to illlustrate my previous point with an example, wherein I stress the secondary effect I use is by no means certain (or maybe even likely):

Miami is currently battling flooding as a direct result of sea level rise [1]. So a very simple response could be to divest from Miami beachfront property and invest in the other American coast, for example San Diego. However, a possible secondary effect would be the flipping of the prevailing winds, which may lead to typhoons/hurricanes regularly showing up on the San Diego shore. We'll say that's less than ideal.


#### What to do?
Well since we can't predict the future with any certainty, we can try to rule any major effects out. The better we study and know our planet's complex climate system, the higher our confidence of certain outcomes can be. Many sources of information about climate change [2][3][4] (there are plenty more resources, but this is a good start and otherwise: Google is your friend) are already publishing information freely, so a prudent first step is to get informed. While ideally everyone should understand the basic science behind the conclusions, sometimes just reading the executive summaries and looking up basic trends can be a huge help. Many of these reports show the possible effects of climate change over the course of the next 10-100 years, including food scarcity, water security issues, extreme weather etc. 

While I believe we can still do much (and should) to mitigate the worst potential effects, I think we've passed a point of no return such that the climate will change permanently and it is up to us to not only adapt, but also to see where we can take advantage of this in a way that helps us all (moving agriculture centers, investing in water purification plants, building hurricane proof housing, etc). 

While I already follow the topic with considerable interest, I plan to do some more in depth research of my own. Hopefully leading to a little extra knowledge that can help us make the best of the situation and perhaps even use it as an opportunity to better ourselves.
