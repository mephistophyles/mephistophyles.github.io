## List of projects to consider:

* blog pos/business ideat: brick and mortar 3d printing franchise, which hosts several larger and medium sized 3d printers as well as access to large databases of products, so they can create things on demand locally, ship them out, but also design things in shop for you (small customizations). Add pick up options like the DHL and Amazon pick up stations, if you don't pick in 2 weeks, it simply gets melted down again.
* Cape Cod Solar
    * Consider the costs and benefits to the various shareholders if Boston/Cape Cod area were to roll out a plan to give its various residents the same offer for subsidized solar pannel buy-back over the first 10 years. Could this offer scale to other places like California, Phoenix, Miami or even Minneapolis?
    * How would it increase Massachussett's rank in this http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/
* Someone pierces the Aswan dam in Egypt. What happens then?
    * What about other famous dams, Hoover, Three Gorges, etc
    * Are they maybe more vulnerable (like in the US due to bad maintenance) to increasingly extreme weather than we think
* Charity that focuses on food distribution. 
    * There are a number of ways this can be accomplished, either through distribution of goods that are passed their sell-by date but not rotten (a soup kitchen won't turn it away, assuming we can get past the legal issue of who is responsible if the food isn't quite good).
    * We could also do something similar with restaurants, which probably also throw away a fair amount of good food, that though maybe not presentable could provide a filling meal to those that are needy.
* Want to really mess with the us? Sever the Internet cables going to various major cities, especially new York and DC. Also silicon Valley and near many large banking servers (a la fight Club).
    * What about exacerbating a drought by hurting water access during the crucial growing stage of most US cash crops?
* Make a visualization based on potential Antarctic habitable area due to climate change (see map here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/29/six-maps-that-will-make-you-rethink-the-world/?utm_term=.78409a7173c8), estimate areas worth building on vs growing on, population support and other factors of economic interest. 
    * Current estimations is not for another 200 years
* Map the opening up of the northern straight as global warming takes course.  When will it (partially) open up and what will this effect be on the Panama canal.
    * Use GIS and the various current realistic projects based on climate change models to map out the course comparison; time, cost and fuel savings vs the Panama Canal. 
    * Resources:
        * http://vterrain.org/Elevation/global.html
        * USGS earth explorer has 30m resolution height data (as well as the older 90m resolution) from here: http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/
    * Things to keep in mind: 
        * deep draft vs shallow draft vessels, and sea level rising
        * Canadian Waters vs International Waters
        * Type of goods worth shipping, (possible) marine sanctuaries
* Perform research into potentially automating the process of loading and unloading from check in and the plane and then back to the carousel
* Scale the input on a phone camera to show the near ir as red and compress the other wavelengths to give a sense of what it could be like to see in the ir or near UV.
    * Maybe get the pi noir sensor as part of it. 
    * This or maybe have an overlap version of the scene, where the IR and UV information supplement the image.
    * Since expanding our senses can either be done in a 'blended' or two discrete systems. But they always end up working together to give information about the world in front of us.
* How would a planet's surface look like under lighting from a planet like Neptune and it's rings. What about in orbit around Saturn? Simulate this in udk or unity?
* My genome. An app that introduces the concepts behind a genome and DNA and all the fun stuff to be learnt from it. Small games to reinforce the knowledge. Fun and accessible for young and not too silly for it to be useless to adults
* Product idea; similar to the 3d printed tooth brush replacement, but make it several possible sizes so that people can buy the correct sizes for their teeth. Similar to mouth guard. Modular, cheap and Mass produce able. 
    * With a media blitz and available everywhere, could grab a huge chunk of the market if it is indeed better than brushing your teeth in every possible category. Then after doing so. Sell to Unilever or Johnson's & Johnson's
* Create a map/book/visualization for the great battles of history, start with the ones of the second Punic war
* Do the math on a solar powered water electrolysis station. How Much area of solar panels do you need get a decent amount of h2 and o2. 
* Website/app idea;  compare how related on a genomic level we are. Do so for animals, plants and humans... maybe make a game out of it...
* Evaluate the current visualizations and videos of Pavlopetri- Greece, if none of them are any good, consider making a proper 3d visualization for others to look at so the information about the sunken city is beter presentable.
* Calculate the current land value (not including economic output) of the various areas of the US that were owned by the various tribes before Europeans settled there. Figure out how much each tribe member would theoretically be worth. Also add a comparison of how the lands would have developed had Europeans not 'taken over'
* Weave battery material through a coat. Have inside coat pockets as inductive chargers
* Could you make a drone even more maneuverable by adding an extra degree of freedom to its rotors. Allowing the to go from vertical to a few degrees away from normal to the drone. How much more complex would the control scheme be?
* Similar to the ML/DL project with the dimensions, consider perhaps showing that an unsupervised approach can yield various physical formulae. Throw in every measurable variable (temp, speed of ball, constants) and take some 'raw' data from famous experiments in history and see if you can find a result?
* Create a simple ML algorithm that uses a simple ML technique (like gradient descent) to optimize/design a mechanical part of something. Choose a part that can be easily measured/evaluated for efficiency.  Show how the ML algorithm (maybe add some sort of genetic or evolutionary algorithm aspect to it) finds novel, but efficient solutions (inspiration: 
    * https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/exploringtheuniverse/borg.html)
* Write about the overlap and dealings between the various civilizations that history teaches people in discrete gruops. Romans, Egyptian, Greek, Chinese, meso American, Japanese, Celts, Vikings, etc
* Create a web app that can be used to store various lacrosse stats for a team. FO, win, shot, shot on goal, etc
    * Collaborate with Jorick?
* Software that analyzes football games, play by play. First it abstracts the video to a 3d skeleton of all players and identifies then by number and team. Then it identifies the play (run, pass, play action, etc) and identifies weaknesses and strengths of the play and it's result. Then based on all plays by a team it finds patterns and identifies them (qb only looks left, stares down wr, run plays never go for more than a yard on certain formations, 3rd down habits, weak corners, etc)
    * How much of this is already being done by next-gen stats?
* In a similar project to the northern straight, research how the various climate projections could affect the trade winds and other major wind patterns of the planet. 
    * Map their current general behavior and see if there are any current projections for their change (if any). If not and there is a change, consider writing a paper.
* Diy herb garden for every cook and cook wannabe. Also offer a set up that allows you to create one that smells nice too. 
    * Maybe also a terrarium. Or other growing diy projects like the strawberry tower.
* For a portfolio project on the side, you can employ some fluid mechanics knowledge you may need to keep up for the retake by simulating the karman vortices:
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_vortex_street
* Perhaps a small project to show off on your portfolio and problemsolving abilities, create a small daemon in windows that shows the status of your android phone that's plugged into your computer charging (like email updates and battery %)
    * Similar to airdroid I guess but just a small tray icon running in the background.
* Create a startup that makes a small flying  drone that can be sent into a small enclosed space like a cave or a hut, and show on a tablet what's inside. 
* Research Net Neutrality in China, especially as spearheaded by Baidu, Alibab and such. Could there be an increasing trend of high tech businesses and innovation coming from China and could they be the new center around which tech infrastructure could revolve?
* A DL technique that uses speech input and nlp techniques to learn the speech and voice patterns of someone. Maybe employ the technique of Gan or other ways to make it work off minimal training data
* Map of Syrian towns, showing the relative population decreases. Contrast it to similar decreases of American/European towns after major events like the plague or WWI
* Interactive simulation or fly by of Mars with various levels of water and atmosphere and temperature range.
    * Start with a simple map/globe, then add potential water levels, vegetation and maybe even habitations. 
* Design a machine learning system that takes sample inputs from people's handwriting and is able to learn their style for new words
* Store carbon in Australia or the Sahara. Grow genetically engineered trees that produce fruit or something else you can sell. Only thing you lack is water and irrigation of nutrient rich water.
* Automated farm. With tractors and harvesters among other implements redesigned to be fully autonomous. Use drones and other sensors to be able to micromanage the crops. Have a field that's one crop and another that'd multi cropped. Compare yield, efficiency and robustness 
* Measure NFL team position groups not only on their effectiveness as a position ranking, but also relative to their cap hit.
