My name is Phil. I'm an engineer and developer. I've spent the last year at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, working under Martin Schuster to develop tools for research in multi-robot SLAM techniques. Since my time at DLR ends on the 31st of March, I'm currently in the market for new opportunities and challenges. My strengths and interests are in (but not limited to) the following: 

* Simulations and visualizations to create actionable intelligence.
* Robotics
* Open Science and communication between the scientific community and the public at large
* Machine Learning
* Teaching
* Synthetic, Systems, and Computational Biology

### Background Information

I've had the priviledge of growing up in numerous countries around the world (the United States, South Korea, Belgium, and Cuba just to name a few), this has served as a catalyst for my side interests in international relations, history and learning. Besides my work at DLR and research at the Delft Biorobotics Lab at the TU Delft, I've also spent time as a developer for a big data consultancy, a middle/high school teacher and a lacrosse coach, and national lacrosse team player. 

I'm passionate about learning and passing that on to others. Hopefully the items under the projects tab here give you a glimpse of my diverse background and interests. My hobbies include:

* Electronics (Arduino, Raspberry pi projects) and domotics
* Chess
* Lacrosse
* Writing (maybe someday this can become more than a hobby)
* Hiking and traveling
