My name is Phil. I'm an engineer and developer. I've spent the last year at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, working under Martin Schuster to develop tools for research in mutli-robot SLAM techniques. I'm currently in the market for new opportunities and challenges.

### More information

I've had the priviledge of growing up in numerous countries around the world (the United States, South Korea, Belgium and Cuba just to name a few), this has served as a catalyst for my interests in international relations, history and learning. Besides my work at DLR and research at the Delft Biorobotics Lab at the TU Delft, I've also spent time as a developer for a big data consultancy, a middle/high school teacher and a lacrosse coach. 

I'm passionate about learning and passing that on to others. Hopefully the items under the projects tab here give you a glimpse of my diverse background and interests.
