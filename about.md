My name is Phil Heijkoop. I like to style myself as a full-stack machine learning engineer. I've spent a year and a half at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, working under Martin Schuster to develop tools for research in multi-robot SLAM techniques. Afterwards I returned to the Netherlands and picked up at Veneficus (my employer before I left for Germany), where I worked closely with the data science and software development teams to help create reproducible data-science tools for our clients. I now live in Boston and am looking for my next challenge.

### Background Information

I've had the privilege of growing up in numerous countries around the world (the United States, South Korea, Belgium, and Cuba just to name a few), this has served as a catalyst for my interests in international relations, history and learning. Besides my experience at DLR and Veneficus, I've also spent time doing research in bipedal robotic locomotion, teaching at a middle/high school, coaching lacrosse, and playing on the Dutch national team. 

I'm passionate about learning and passing that on to others. Hopefully the items under the projects tab here give you a glimpse of my diverse background and interests. My hobbies include:

* Electronics (Arduino, Raspberry pi projects) and domotics
* Reading and writing
* Hiking and traveling
