I promise this isn't a pun on my name, but I felt a site telling people who I am and what I've done would be incomplete without at least some mention of lacrosse. The sport has been my passion for the last 10 years. I've gotten to play on a wide number of levels, against and with some incredibly talented individuals, coach and ref to help grow the game. The game has given me a lot, not least of which allowing me to meet an amazing amount of quality people all over the world.
