title: Why I Blog

The reasons to blog are numerous. Besides this site functioning as a portfolio to display my skills, it also allows me to practice other useful skills such as relaying information in an efficient manner. The above serves me, personally, but should hopefully also serve as a way to help others in similar positions or wishing to solve similar problems. 

Another reason I have the blog is it forces me to articulate my thoughts on things I wish to post, whether it's a philosophy on designing small projects or my thoughts on TDD (I think it's akin to communism, more on that in the actual post). 

It also serves for me to look back on previous projects and see how I've changed, whether it's the areas of interest to me, coding style (this is usually accompanied by cringing) or just a reminder of projects I still have running. Putting them out there is an extra incentive to work on them, even though this added peer pressure is largely imaginary.

Finally, not necessarily a reason to blog, but a reason to keep the online presence. Plenty of information that is associated with this site is not available to those visiting it. I have plenty of draft posts, a few projects that aren't fully finished or written up, or a whole new section I want to add in due time. I see these things every time I open up the folder it is kept in locally or when I visit the private repository. It motivates me to work.
