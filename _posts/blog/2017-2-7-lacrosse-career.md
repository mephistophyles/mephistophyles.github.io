I felt a site telling people who I am and what I've done would be incomplete without at least some mention of lacrosse. The sport has been my passion for the last 10+ years. I've gotten to play on a wide number of levels, against and with some incredibly talented individuals, coach and ref to help grow the game. The game has given me a lot, not least of which allowing me to meet an amazing amount of quality people all over the world. This is just a brief look back at my lacrosse career.

### (Brief) Overview of my Playing Career

I started out playing in high school, briefly. I played on the inaugural International School of Brussels team. Afterwards, when I went to college, I had to choose whether I wanted to row or play lacrosse. I chose to commute to the Hague to play lacrosse for my freshman year. The summer after my freshman year (2007) I founded the Delft Barons lacrosse club. I coached both the men's and the women's team, despite not knowing a huge amount of lacrosse at the time, eventually relinquishing these roles to the players on each team who volunteered to take over. 

The Delft Barons quickly grew a nucleus of passionate players, which pushed us to all get involved with the sport more. We all joined various development prorgams and eventually in 2010 two of our players (me being one of them) were selected to the Dutch national team out of four who tried out. That year we also won the Dutch National Lacrosse League (DNLL)'s second devision, granting us the opportunity to play in the first. We took this opportunity to expand our core group of guys and push ourselves as a team to do more. Our first year in the first division we made it to the finals of the play offs, losing to the perenial powerhouse, Amsterdam.

Coming off this loss, we redoubled our efforts. As try-outs had started for the 2012 national team and the first U19 national team, we sent more players than any other team to the try-outs. Eventually landing five players on each. Together with hiring a former NCAA player as a coach, 2012 was our year. We made it to the finals again except this time we triumphed over the team from our nation's capital.

As a national team player, I was privileged enough to play in a World Championship in 2010 and a European Championship in 2012. I made the squad initially as a defensive midfielder, emphasizing my athleticism and coachability. I worked my way up to being the starting defensive midfielder, and our team managed to make it all the way to the quarter finals where we fell to Japan in a close game. We eventually placed 8th overall.  Two years later, I made the team as an offensive midfielder, having spent a lot of effort improving my dodging, shooting and off-hand. 

Throughout this time I spent many summer weekends at tournaments, making friends and playing a more loose and carefree style of lacrosse. I played on the Global Players team with NCAA players, as well as being a starting midfielder for the Crazy Cows. I also played with European all stars at invitationals. Most notably a D-day memorial tournament in Nornmandy, France where we played against Hobart. Or in 2014 with a group of all-stars from the UK against the national teams of Norway, Italy and the Univeristy of Notre Dame. 

I eventually moved to Munich, Germany, where I met up with a large number of players I had shared the field with before (mostly as opponents). Here I was a midfielder and man-up specialist. I no longer had the same athleticism as I did before and had to rely more on 'veteran wiles'. We were runner-ups at the German championships. 

Besides playing the game, I developed a passion for coaching and reffing. I am an FIL licensed level 2 referee, as well as having coached a number of team in Leiden, Delft and Munich. This is something I foresee myself continuing in well after my playing days are over.


### Nuggets

Throughout the past decade, I have learned a number of things that I believe transfer from the game of lacrosse to real life. These modest little pearls of wisdom I share here, hoping they benefit anyone else, but even if they don't, let them serve as a reminder to me

* The more you learn about something, the more you can appreciate the unsung heroes. A common adage in lacrosse is "the game's 2 most important statistics are turnovers and groundballs". Throughout the years, I've grown to watch the games differently, not only appreciating beautiful goals, but also the smaller plays that go unnoticed by most spectators. In life it is often similarly the work of people who aren't always getting the credit that makes stuff function.
* The best player on the field won't ever beat the best team on the field. Probably most poignantly illustrated in the 2008 NCAA finals where the best player (Paul Rabil) did everything he could to keep his Blue Jays in the game, but the Syracuse team was just better and eventually triumphed. Often times teamwork will win out, as corny and cliche as it may seem, teamwork does make the dream work.
* Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. In lacrosse a player can make up for a fair bit with superior athleticism and grit. Groundballs and defensive hussle are not a function of talent but more determination, so persistence is a true virtue. Doggedly going after what you want is often just a question of outworking someone (even if it's just the voice in the back of your head telling you you're tired). Once you achieve your goal, all that work was proven correct. The converse however is also true, when someone is more talented and puts in just as much work, you're doomed. You have to pick your battles and knowing when you can win and when (or how) you can't can be just as crucial
* The virtues of ditch digging. Performances on the field are often the culmination of a lot of hard work put in elsewhere. Extra sprints outside of practice, extra shooting, more time in the gym, it all adds up. Similarly being prepared for other situations in life, such as looking up background information on someone you are going to meet with, can often help you achieve what you set out to do more easily.

### More Info Coming Someday

These are by no means a final list. I will probably add to them as I think of others. One day I hope to create some resources for players who want to learn more about how to play various positions. In my time coaching I've come across a number of common things that most new players aren't aware of, but a small correction can make everything much smoother.
