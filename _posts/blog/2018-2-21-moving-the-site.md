title: Moving the site

This is a quick announcement that the site is moving. It's not a simple migration, but a whole rebuild. I set up this github-pages site a few years ago, when I wanted to prioritize content over style. But I recently grew frustrated enough with my own limitations in Ruby (a language I don't know or work with), and primarily bothered by having Django experience, but not Django projects online. So why not bite the bullet and kill two birds with one large boulder. 

I don't want to stop formatting my posts in markdown (it's so much nicer than html or anything else), so that's a feature that needs to be included. But I've also decided I want to be a bit stricter with myself. The layout will be a bit easier to work with and the definitions of what falls under blog and what falls under project also needed to be set.

A project is now something I consider done to the point where I feel confident showing it to the outside world. The work doesn't need to be finished for it to end up on the projects page, but it should be advanced enough that a third party could make sense of it. The projects page will be just that, a single page. It'll probably become some kind of gallery/list, and some old projects will likely be retired from there (but still in the blog space, so come up with searches).

Blogs will now be everything. I'll keep track of them with tags, enable searching, all the usual features. But I also want to have (possibly in multiple parts) write ups for projects in there.

I've also added a tab for writing, I had that on this site too, but it was hidden. Now it just doesn't yet link to the anything, but I do intend to actually finish up some writing. Whether it gets picked up by a publisher or it just remains some screaming into the void will remain to be seen, but I've decided it's something important enough to me that it (eventually) belongs on a site that showcases my work.
