title: Combined Heat and Power Plant for Hospital
blog_group: project
---
For my second year project, a group of us had to design a compined heat and power plant for a hospital in Hungary. The project was based on a real case study that the responsible professor was consulting for.

The design parameters (full list inside the file document) included a reliable source of three-phase electrical power, warm water and steam for the hospital under varying seasonal and load conditions. The terrain, economics and sustainability were also factors that influenced our design choice.
