title: Bachelor's Thesis&#58 Blood Droplet Launcher
blog_group: project
---


For my bachelor's thesis, I worked in a group that was asked to build a blood drop launcher for the Dutch Forensics Institute (NFI) to test an improved model that had for determining the origin of blood droplets.

The new theory replaced the old convention of using strings (similar to what's seen in the TV show Dexter) from the blood droplets and tracing back origins based on expert intuition and some educated guesswork to a common origin. The new method was based on using a portable 3D scanner to measure the various blood droplets' volume and dimension to get an accurate indication of impact angle and speed. From this and a 3D scan of the room, fluid mechanics knowledge would be applied to develop a computation model of where the blood droplets had originated that takes into account gravity, drag and other external forces neglected by the old model.

The final paper (available [here]({{site.url}}/assets/final_113_paper.pdf)) shows some of the processed images and an indication of where the prototype was going. The final design dossier and all the raw data can not be released due to the signing of an NDA agreement with the NFI.
